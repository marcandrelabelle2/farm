  the beauty of Quebec's agricultural and culinery heritage. \
  Our company's growth was made with those who share the desire to comeback \
  to the basics, while enjoying great food and beautiful landscapes.",
  hist: "Our journey began at the Au Pied Levé farm where the owners, \
  Denis et Marie-Thérèse, allowed us to create a garden on their land. \
  They've thaugh us to go the extra mile when it comes to good farming. \
  After a year, we've had an opportunity to move a few miles ouest \
  on the other side of the Mempgremagog lake.",
  effort:
    "Once there, a team of workers and volunteers have been working \
  tirelessly to prepare the soil, the greenhous, the picnic tables \
  and the kitchen to offer an exceptionnal country table. \
  Parcelles is a business where the nature meets savory dishes \
  for a tasty and soothing moment.",
